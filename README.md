### Hi there 👋
### This is Yukun Tian!
### It's a pleasure to meet you!

- 👯 I am now studying at the Southeast University and my major is Artificial Intelligence. (I really love it!😊)  
- 🔭 I’m interested in computer vision, machine learning and Robotics. Currently, I am mainly working on Event-based Vision and Parallel Computing. (fighting with ddl /(ㄒoㄒ)/~~)  
- 🌱 I am now leading the R&D of my school's Robotics Team. (Mainly on vision tasks 👁)
- 🖥️ Between 2024.7 - 2024.9, I had an internship in Huawei as an AI Engineer, where I am responsible for Ascend operator dev (not so AI🤔).
- ⚡ Hobbies: taking photos, playing badminton, reading...  
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is 213221787@seu.edu.cn  
- 💬 Ask me anything you are curious about! Find more on my [PW](https://ttiannaitt.github.io/) (Notice: Some pages are not finished yet. I'm sorry...)

-  ✨ On this website you can find #part# of my engineering and research work, but I will update it as soon as possible! ✨

PS： Part of my work (Most of Robotics program and some open-source software) is managed using Gitee or CodeHub (Another two code repo tools like Github). So some programs can not be found here.
